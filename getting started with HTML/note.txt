DOCTYPE------

<!DOCTYPE html>: We start the file with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. It tells the browser what type of document to 
expect.

 The <DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages 
correctly.

 It must appear only once, at the top of the page(before HTML tag)4

 The <DOCTYPE>  declaration is not case sensitive.
